    "# Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Predict customer churn using transactional and demographic data.  \n",
    "This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow: EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → interpretation → business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "- Source: <describe or link if public>\n",
    "- Size: ~N rows, M features\n",
    "- Target: `churn` (0 = retained, 1 = churned)\n",
    "- Notes: class imbalance present\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. **EDA** — distributions, missing values, correlations; churn rate by segments.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering** — recency/engagement deltas, ratios, tenure buckets; categorical encoding; robust scaling.\n",
    "3. **Modeling** — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost inside a `sklearn` `Pipeline`.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation** — Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, **PR-AUC**; confusion matrices; threshold tuning.\n",
    "5. **Interpretation** — feature importances and SHAP (global + local).\n",
    "6. **Business Insights** — actions to reduce churn for high-risk segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results (example numbers — replace with yours)\n",
    "- Best model: **XGBoost**\n",
    "- PR-AUC: **0.87**, ROC-AUC: **0.96**, Recall @ 0.5: **0.78**\n",
    "- Key drivers: `tenure`, `monthly_charges`, `activity_delta`, `contract_type`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Takeaways\n",
    "- Customers with short tenure and recent activity drop have elevated churn risk.\n",
    "- Proactive retention offers for top 10% risk decile can reduce expected churn by X%.\n",
